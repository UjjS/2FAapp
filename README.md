# 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) Application

This is a simple Node.js and Express application that demonstrates two-factor authentication (2FA) using Speakeasy, MongoDB for user storage, and QR codes for setup.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2fa-application.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd 2fa-application
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the application:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    The server will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2. Fill in the registration form to register a new user. The server will provide a QR code for 2FA setup.
3. Use an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to scan the QR code and generate OTPs.
4. Fill in the verification form with your username and the OTP generated by the authenticator app to verify.

## Important Notes

- This is a basic example for educational purposes. In a production environment, additional security measures and considerations should be implemented.

- Make sure to secure your MongoDB connection and handle errors more gracefully in a real-world scenario.

- The application is configured to connect to a MongoDB database named `2fa-example`. Adjust the connection URI in `index.js` if needed.
